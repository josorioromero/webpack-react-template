# Webpack template exercise

The purpose of this repo is to build a complete
webpack template to develop with React.js just
cloning it everytime you want to start a new React.js
project using ES6. In the future the idea is to create
a Yeoman generator with this configuration because
Yeoman is full of React.js boilerplates using es5, not es6.
